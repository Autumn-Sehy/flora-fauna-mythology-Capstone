This is the final capstone for my flora/fauna project, which includes: running biodiversity metrics on mythology, emotion analysis on flora/fauna, and topic modeling, among many other tasks. Please enjoy my emoji-laden code.
My database isn't public yet, as I'm still collecting myths. I'm going to the Boston Digital Humanities Symposium, and will have the database available online before then!
